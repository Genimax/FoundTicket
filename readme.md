# **FoundTicket**
## *How about knowing your targets?*

"FoundTicket" is a program for those who wish to enter the foundation.app platform, but do not know where to look for artists with invites. Your goal is to reach the right people, the goal of this program is to give you their contacts.

- Enter the number of artists to scan for invites.
- Do not touch your browser, which will be opened.
- When it's done check "Links" in the main folder.
- You will have 3 Excel files, which contains links to artists with invites, their instagrams and twitters.

## **How does it work?**

- The program makes a request to the site to search for authors with sorting "From new to old".
- Further, the program makes requests in the authors' profiles for the presence of sold works (this means that these authors were given invites and most likely they did not spend them, since they are relatively recent on the platform, thanks to sorting)
- As soon as the program realized which of the authors might have invites, it pulls their social networks from their profiles and saves all this in Excel tables.

## **How to:**

- Install Google Chrome if you don't have it already.
- Open "Foundation.exe".
- Enter the amount of authors you want to scan (usually 1 of 3 authors has invites).
- Wait for it.
- Check "Links" folder in the main folder.
- **Start writing to your targets and get your invite.**

**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**
